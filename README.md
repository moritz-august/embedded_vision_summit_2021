# Deploying PyTorch Models for Real-time Inference On the Edge

This is some example code I provided with my talk on "Deploying PyTorch Models for Real-time Inference On the Edge" at Embedded Vision Summit 2021.

The code illustrates some basic techniques for optimizing and compressing convolutional neural networks as well as preparing them for on-device execution via PyTorch and ONNX Runtime.
